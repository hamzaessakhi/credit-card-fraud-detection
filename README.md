# credit-card-fraud-detection

# Abstract

The project aims to classify the fraudulent transactions of credit cards, with high accuracy. The Credit Card Fraud Detection problem includes modeling credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turns out to be fraud. Such modeling will enable companies to efficiently flag a transaction which may be fraudulent. 

# The dataset 
The dataset consists of simulated credit card transactions containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The dataset is in csv format and has been taken from the Kaggle public dataset. Data has been generated using Sparkov Data Generation tool created by Brandon Harris (Duration-Jan 1, 2019 to Dec 31, 2020). 
  - The data consists of around 1.3 million transactions having details of 1000 customers with a pool of 800 merchants. 
  - It consists of 21 features. Some of the important features are cc_num, merchant, category, amount, gender, city_population, job, date of birth, is_fraud, city, state,zip etc.

# Goal 
To predict the fraudulent transaction with 100% accuracy.
